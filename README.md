# Monte-Carlo-Buffon-Needle
Simulation of the buffons needle experiment, using Monte-Carlo methods and symmetrical methods in the problem.


During the 18th century Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon posed a question regarding the probabilistic nature of a simple event, the tossing of a needle. The question asked: what is the chance that a needle dropped randomly onto a floor marked with equally spaced parallel lines will cross one of the lines? The resulting solution of this problem paved a new way of analyzing probabilities of geometric events called Geometric probability

In this repository, a method of constructing a Monte-Carlo simulation of multiple 'dropping' events will be explained in order to find the probability of a needle crossing a floor line. In addition to this simulation, a method of determining this probability will be derived using the intrinsic symmetries in the problem.
